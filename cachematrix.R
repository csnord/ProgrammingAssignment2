# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 
# The following is a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  #This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
  print("hello")
}



# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
# makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
# (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
# the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  print("hello")
}
